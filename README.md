# Todux

The user-centred and community-driven to-do app.


This project has been created to learn and polish skills with django and python. 

Strongly inspired by [todoist](https://todoist.com/).


## Model 

- User
    - Tasks
    - Projects 
    - Tags


Each task can only be assigned to one project. Each task can have as many tags as you want.
