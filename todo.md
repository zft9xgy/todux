- Real changes to the counter of tags, projects.

- Error control when a tag cannot be created by unique value: owner-tag.name. That is, when you try to create a tag with a name that already exists, it is not created and does not seem to work, notify the user of the error.

- Control that no more than two elements can be edited at the same time. I mean, when you click on edit and click on another edit, it closes the first one and asks if you want to save. like here: https://htmx.org/examples/edit-row/

- When creating an eituqeta from the sidebar, control that it can be cancelled once the button is clicked. With ESC or by clicking out.

- Apply better styling to inputs https://codepen.io/lucasyem/pen/ZEEYKdj / https://freefrontend.com/css-input-text/
